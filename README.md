# Term-Deposit-Marketing

In this project, I perform exploratory data analysis on a dataset consisting of customer marketing data to identify the most significant attributes of the data.  Secondly, I apply a few classification models and identify the best-performing models in regard to accuracy, precision, and recall.  The European banking institution, for which we are doing the analysis, can identify which features of their customers are most significant for subscription in order to improve marketing efforts.
